## :pencil2: Description

A widget factory is a theme preview application for gtk2 and gtk3.
It displays the various widget types provided by gtk2/gtk3 in a single window allowing to see the visual effect of the applied theme.

## :pushpin: Status

**Warning**: it's quite some time I haven't looked at gtk3 to integrate the latest widgets, and I don't plan to work on this tool anymore.
AWF was indeed created a long time ago when neither gtk2 nor gtk3 were providing such a tool.  
As part of gtk3 there is now [gtk3-widget-factory](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk3-widget-factory.html) and gtk4 will provide [gtk4-widget-factory](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk4/stable/gtk4-widget-factory.html).

## :bookmark: Features

- Display widget types available in gtk2/gtk3 (remark: option menu widget type only exists in gtk2, switch and level bar widget types only exist in gtk3)
- Menus to select the themes available either at system level or user level
- Toolbar button to start the other gtk version of the tool
- Toolbar button to refresh the current theme (not working anymore in latest versions of gtk3)
- Refresh the current theme on SIGHUP
